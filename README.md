Nice USB Meter with BLE

The BLE module inside this nice device is RS02A1-B... RF-star piece...

You can customize the name and other BLE broadcast parameters.
The bash script unbrick.sh can be used for recovery no magic inside, factory reset and baud rate settings just for sure...
The customized BLE dump from my device can be also help full, can be created by fnb58_dump.sh's output.
