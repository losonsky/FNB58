Nice USB Meter with BLE

The BLE module inside this nice device is RS02A1-B... RF-start piece

You can customize the name and other BLE broadcast parameters.
The bash script can be used for recovery no magic inside, factory reset and baud rate settings just for sure...
The customized BLE dump from my device can be also help full.
